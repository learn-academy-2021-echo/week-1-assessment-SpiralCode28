# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:

  - GitHub is an online platform which allows many people to work off of it and collaborate on a project. Git is local software that is on your computer.

  Researched answer:

  - GitHub is an online platform and graphical user interface that works for the local, git software. Git is software that is local and not online.


2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

  - True or false questions

  Researched answer:

  - Anything that evaluates an expression.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

  - Index is referring to a space being held that holds a value within it. A value is what an element is.

  Researched answer:

  - Within an array, you have values which are separated by commas. Each value has an index that lets you know it's location, starting with "0." Moving through the array, the location of the value goes up by a whole number. Indexes are sequential numbers. Values can be changed unlike indexes.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:

  - An iteration is an explanation.

  Researched answer:

  - An iteration is an object that defines a sequence.  With it you can execute a function over and over until you have the outcome you want.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

  - Pair programming has two roles. They are the "driver" and the "navigator." The two people work together to get code written as accurately as possible. The driver types the information given my the navigator. The navigator goes over the code in real time while giving the driver instructions. Switching roles allows them to take breaks with their previous role and uses teamwork to make it as accurate as possible.

  Researched answer:

  - Proper pair programming techniques are as followed:


  - Pair programming has two roles. They are the "driver" and the "navigator." The navigator will be going over the task and steps for that text, but not necessarily being specific on what keys to enter.

  - Proper pair programming techniques are as followed:
    - Constant communication with the partner
    - Switching roles often every 10 - 20 minutes
    - keep distractions at a minimum
    - both have eyes on the code



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:

  - I'm a visual leaner and I find it was VERY helpful when Austin drew out (on a whiteboard) his explanation of what the GitHub's pulling and pushing process looked like. He also showed how multiple people - on one project - work from "main" on their separate branches.

  - When Sarah uses multiple examples to show how the code works I understand it better.  


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request: Telling another that they can review a branch that was submitted to the repository.

2. Higher Order Functions: Functions that operate on or change other functions.

3. Jest: A way to test code without making changes to a system.

4. Objects: Data types that contain collections of Keys and Values. They may contain properties and meethods.

5. Classes: A blueprint for Objects. Encapsulates data with the code to work on data.
