# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:

  - GitHub is an online platform which allows many people to work off of it and collaborate on a project. Git is local software that is on your computer.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

  - Index is referring to a space being held that holds a value within it. A value is what an element is.

  Researched answer:

  - Within an array, you have values which are separated by commas. Each value has an index that lets you know it's location, starting with "0." Moving through the array, the location of the value goes up by a whole number. Indexes are sequential numbers. Values can be changed unlike indexes.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:

  - An iteration is an explanation.

  Researched answer:

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

  - Pair programming has two roles. They are the "driver" and the "navigator." The two people work together to get code written as accurately as possible. The driver types the information given my the navigator. The navigator goes over the code in real time while giving the driver instructions. Switching roles allows them to take breaks with their previous role and uses teamwork to make it as accurate as possible.

  Researched answer:

  - Proper pair programming techniques are as followed:
    -

  - Pair programming has two roles. They are the "driver" and the "navigator." The navigator will

6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:

  - I'm a visual leaner and I find it was VERY helpful when Austin drew out (on a whiteboard) his explanation of what the GitHub's pulling and pushing process looked like. He also showed how multiple people - on one project - work from "main" on their separate branches.

  - When Sarah uses multiple examples to show how the code works I understand it better.
